Leaves are on the ground
Fall has come
Blue skies turning grey
Like my love
I tried to carry you
And make you whole
But it was never enough
I must go
And who is gonna save you
When I'm gone?
And who'll watch over you
When I'm gone?
You say you care for me
But hide it well
How can you love someone
And not yourself?
And who is gonna save you
When I'm gone?
And who'll watch over you
When I'm gone?
